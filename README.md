# Morphic Credentials

Morphic Credentials is a tiny Windows Installer (MSI) that installs the Morphic client credentials into a secure area of the filesystem.

## Usage

The secret needs to be generated manually and copied into a file called secret.txt.

Run build.ps1

Remember, DO NOT commit the secret.txt file. :)
